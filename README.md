# Knowledge Treasury

This repository will stand as a mechanism to track and retain knowledge that I have found useful or pertinent to my journey in the tech world.

This is not an official guide to anything, nor can I promise that the information contained within is 100% accurate. While this is intended for personal use, I see no reason why others can't benefit from it. Always make sure to fact check something you see in here, especially if it seems incorrect. We are always learning, growing, and iterating!

By creating this I hope that others and myself can improve their mindset when dealing with these topics. I have found in my experinece that people like to get surface level information and then run with it. Don't be that person.
